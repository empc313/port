                I am a person who loves to learn. I am continuously learning about many different things in the world
				around me, there is so much knowledge from both the past and present; I am fascinated by all of it.

			Embroidery and oil painting are something I am extremley fond of. Figuring out which colors to use and
			creating something is the best part.
